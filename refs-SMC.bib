	abstract = {Statistical Model Checking (SMC) is a computationally very efficient verification technique based on selective system sampling. One well identified shortcoming of SMC is that, unlike probabilistic model checking, it cannot be applied to systems featuring nondeterminism, such as Markov Decision Processes (MDP). We address this limitation by developing an algorithm that resolves nondeterminism probabilistically, and then uses multiple rounds of sampling and Reinforcement Learning to provably improve resolutions of nondeterminism with respect to satisfying a Bounded Linear Temporal Logic (BLTL) property. Our algorithm thus reduces an MDP to a fully probabilistic Markov chain on which SMC may be applied to give an approximate solution to the problem of checking the probabilistic BLTL property. We integrate our algorithm in a parallelised modification of the PRISM simulation framework. Extensive validation with both new and PRISM benchmarks demonstrates that the approach scales very well in scenarios where symbolic algorithms fail to do so.},

	abstract = {The fundamentals of probabilistic model checking for Markovian models and temporal properties have been studied extensively in the past 20 years. Research on methods for computing conditional probabilities for temporal properties under temporal conditions is, however, comparably rare. For computing conditional probabilities or expected values under ω-regular conditions in Markov chains, we introduce a new transformation of Markov chains that incorporates the effect of the condition into the model. For Markov decision processes, we show that the task to compute maximal reachability probabilities under reachability conditions is solvable in polynomial time, while it was conjectured to be computationally hard. Using adaptions of known automata-based methods, our algorithm can be generalized for computing the maximal conditional probabilities for ω-regular events under ω-regular conditions. The feasibility of our algorithms is studied in two benchmark examples.},

We interpret cpCTL over Markov Chain and Markov Decision Processes. While model checking cpCTL over Markov Chains can be done with existing techniques, those techniques do not carry over to Markov Decision Processes. We present a model checking algorithm for Markov Decision Processes. We also study the class of schedulers that suffice to find the maximum and minimum probability that φ is true given that ψ is true. Finally, we present the notion of counterexamples for cpCTL model checking and provide a method for counterexample generation.},

	abstract = {Interactive, distributed, and embedded systems often behave stochastically, for example, when inputs, message delays, or failures conform to a probability distribution. However, reasoning analytically about the behavior of complex stochastic systems is generally infeasible. While simulations of systems are commonly used in engineering practice, they have not traditionally been used to reason about formal specifications. Statistical model checking (SMC) addresses this weakness by using a simulation-based approach to reason about precise properties specified in a stochastic temporal logic. A specification for a communication system may state that within some time bound, the probability that the number of messages in a queue will be greater than 5 must be less than 0.01. Using SMC, executions of a stochastic system are first sampled, after which statistical techniques are applied to determine whether such a property holds. While the output of sample-based methods are not always correct, statistical inference can quantify the confidence in the result produced. In effect, SMC provides a more widely applicable and scalable alternative to analysis of properties of stochastic systems using numerical and symbolic methods. SMC techniques have been successfully applied to analyze systems with large state spaces in areas such as computer networking, security, and systems biology. In this article, we survey SMC algorithms, techniques, and tools, while emphasizing current limitations and tradeoffs between precision and scalability.},

	abstract = {This chapter is about the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs) which incorporate one of the fundamental models for reasoning about probabilistic and nondeterministic phenomena in reactive systems. MDPs have their roots in the field of operations research and are nowadays used in a wide variety of areas including verification, robotics, planning, controlling, reinforcement learning, economics and semantics of randomized systems. Furthermore, MDPs served as the basis for the introduction of probabilistic automata which are related to weighted automata. We describe the use of MDPs as an operational model for randomized systems, e.g., systems that employ randomized algorithms, multi-agent systems or systems with unreliable components or surroundings. In this context we outline the theory of verifying ω-regular properties of such operational models. As an integral part of this theory we use ω-automata, i.e., finite-state automata over finite alphabets that accept languages of infinite words. Additionally, basic concepts of important reduction techniques are sketched, namely partial order reduction of MDPs and quotient system reduction of the numerical problem that arises in the verification of MDPs. Furthermore we present several undecidability and decidability results for the controller synthesis problem for partially observable MDPs.},
